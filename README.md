# TitanicSurvivalPrediction

In this project, we estimate the survival chances of a person to survive in a titanic crash. We collect initial data like Name,Ticket,Age,Class,Parch,SibSp and use data science techniques to preprocess the data.
Fill the missing values to NA or the mean of the data row. Now we split the data into training and testing phases. We use 80-90% of the data generally to train the model and remaining to test the model. 
We have a selected the logistic regression model because it works more efficiently on a binary classification model.
Fortunately, we obtained a model whose results are 100%. The input data to test might be given to the csv file attached and reprocess the code.
